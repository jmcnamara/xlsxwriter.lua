Tutorial 1: Create a simple XLSX file
=====================================

Let's start by creating a simple spreadsheet using Lua and the ``xlsxwriter``
module.

Say that we have some data on monthly outgoings that we want to convert into an
Excel XLSX file::

    expenses = {
      {"Rent", 1000},
      {"Gas",   100},
      {"Food",  300},
      {"Gym",    50},
    }

To do that we can start with a small program like the following:

.. code-block:: lua

    local Workbook = require "xlsxwriter.workbook"


    -- Create a workbook and add a worksheet.
    local workbook  = Workbook:new("Expensese01.xlsx")
    local worksheet = workbook:add_worksheet()

    -- Some data we want to write to the worksheet.
    local expenses = {
      {"Rent", 1000},
      {"Gas",   100},
      {"Food",  300},
      {"Gym",    50},
    }

    -- Start from the first cell. Rows and columns are zero indexed.
    local row = 0
    local col = 0

    -- Iterate over the data and write it out element by element.
    for _, expense in ipairs(expenses) do
      local item, cost = unpack(expense)
      worksheet:write(row, col,     item)
      worksheet:write(row, col + 1, cost)
      row = row + 1
    end

    -- Write a total using a formula.
    worksheet:write(row, 0, "Total")
    worksheet:write(row, 1, "=SUM(B1:B4)")

    workbook:close()

If we run this program we should get a spreadsheet that looks like this:

This is a simple example but the steps involved are representative of all
programs that use xlsxwriter, so let's break it down into separate parts.

The first step is to import the module::

    local Workbook = require "xlsxwriter.workbook"

The next step is to create a new workbook object using the ``Workbook:new()``
constructor.

:ref:`Workbook:new() <constructor>` takes one, non-optional, argument which is the filename that we want to create::

    local workbook = Workbook:new("Expensese01.xlsx")

The workbook object is then used to add a new worksheet via the
:func:`add_worksheet` method::

    local worksheet = workbook:add_worksheet()

By default worksheet names in the spreadsheet will be `Sheet1`, `Sheet2` etc.,
but we can also specify a name::

    worksheet1 = workbook:add_worksheet()        -- Defaults to Sheet1.
    worksheet2 = workbook:add_worksheet("Data")  -- Data.
    worksheet3 = workbook:add_worksheet()        -- Defaults to Sheet3.

We can then use the worksheet object to write data via the :func:`write`
method::

    worksheet:write(row, col, some_data)

.. Note::
   Throughout the ``xlsxwriter`` API *rows* and *columns* are zero indexed. Thus,
   the first cell in a worksheet, ``A1``, is ``(0, 0)``.

So in our example we iterate over our data and write it out as follows::

    -- Iterate over the data and write it out element by element.
    for _, expense in ipairs(expenses) do
      local item, cost = unpack(expense)
      worksheet:write(row, col,     item)
      worksheet:write(row, col + 1, cost)
      row = row + 1
    end

We then add a formula to calculate the total of the items in the second column::

    worksheet:write(row, 1, "=SUM(B1:B4)")

Finally, we close the Excel file via the :func:`close` method::

    workbook:close()

And that's it. We now have a file that can be read by Excel and other
spreadsheet applications.

In the next sections we will see how we can use the ``xlsxwriter`` module to add
formatting and other Excel features.
