Working with Memory and Performance
===================================

By default ``xlsxwriter`` holds all cell data in memory. This is to allow future
features where formatting is applied separately from the data.

The effect of this is that for large files ``xlsxwriter`` can consume a lot of memory and it is
even possible to run out of memory.

Fortunately, this memory usage can be reduced almost completely by setting the
:ref:`Workbook:new() <constructor>` ``'constant_memory'`` property::

    workbook = Workbook:new(filename, {constant_memory = true})


The optimisation works by flushing each row after a subsequent row is written.
In this way the largest amount of data held in memory for a worksheet is the
amount of memory required to hold a single row of data.

Since each new row flushes the previous row, data must be written in sequential
row order when ``'constant_memory'`` mode is on::

    -- With 'constant_memory' you must write data in row column order.
    for row = 0, row_max do
      for col = 0, col_max do
        worksheet:write(row, col, some_data)
      end
    end

    -- With 'constant_memory' the following would only write the first column.
    for col = 0, col_max do  -- !!
      for row = 0, row_max do
        worksheet:write(row, col, some_data)
      end
    end

Another optimisation that is used to reduce memory usage is that cell strings
aren't stored in an Excel structure call "shared strings" and instead are
written "in-line". This is a documented Excel feature that is supported by
most spreadsheet applications. One known exception is Apple Numbers for Mac
where the string data isn't displayed.

The trade-off when using ``'constant_memory'`` mode is that you won't be able
to take advantage of any features that manipulate cell data after it is
written. Currently there aren't any such features.

For larger files ``'constant_memory'`` mode also gives an increase in execution
speed, see below.


Performance Figures
-------------------

The performance figures below show execution time and memory usage for
worksheets of size ``N`` rows x 50 columns with a 50/50 mixture of strings and
numbers. The figures are taken from an arbitrary, mid-range, machine. Specific
figures will vary from machine to machine but the trends should be the same.

Xlsxwriter in normal operation mode: the execution time and memory usage
increase more of less linearly with the number of rows:

+-------+---------+----------+----------------+
| Rows  | Columns | Time (s) | Memory (bytes) |
+=======+=========+==========+================+
|   200 | 50      |  0.20    | 2071819        |
+-------+---------+----------+----------------+
|   400 | 50      |  0.40    | 4149803        |
+-------+---------+----------+----------------+
|   800 | 50      |  0.86    | 8305771        |
+-------+---------+----------+----------------+
|  1600 | 50      |  1.87    | 16617707       |
+-------+---------+----------+----------------+
|  3200 | 50      |  3.84    | 33271579       |
+-------+---------+----------+----------------+
|  6400 | 50      |  8.02    | 66599323       |
+-------+---------+----------+----------------+
| 12800 | 50      | 16.54    | 133254811      |
+-------+---------+----------+----------------+

Xlsxwriter in ``constant_memory`` mode: the execution time still increases
linearly with the number of rows but the memory usage remains small and
mainly constant:

+-------+---------+----------+----------------+
| Rows  | Columns | Time (s) | Memory (bytes) |
+=======+=========+==========+================+
|   200 | 50      |  0.18    | 41119          |
+-------+---------+----------+----------------+
|   400 | 50      |  0.36    | 24735          |
+-------+---------+----------+----------------+
|   800 | 50      |  0.69    | 24735          |
+-------+---------+----------+----------------+
|  1600 | 50      |  1.41    | 24735          |
+-------+---------+----------+----------------+
|  3200 | 50      |  2.83    | 41119          |
+-------+---------+----------+----------------+
|  6400 | 50      |  5.83    | 41119          |
+-------+---------+----------+----------------+
| 12800 | 50      | 11.29    | 24735          |
+-------+---------+----------+----------------+

These figures were generated using  the ``perf_tester.lua`` program in the
``examples`` directory of the xlsxwriter repo.

Note, there will be further optimisation in both modes in later releases.
